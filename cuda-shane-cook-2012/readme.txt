Some code from the book:

	[CUDA2012] MK - CUDA Programming, by Shane Cook (2012).pdf

No official source archive provided by the author.

The reader must cherry pick the source code lines from the book, and create CUDA .vcxproj-s 
by himself.

I'm using Visual Studio 2010 with CUDA toolkit 8.0 to compile these code.
